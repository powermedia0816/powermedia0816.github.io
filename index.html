<h2><b><u><font face="Calibri light"><font color="3366FF">About Me</u></b></h2></font>
<p>I am an enthusiastic and hard working team player looking for challenging and rewarding opportunities where I can contribute to the success of the business.
Sales and marketing are the main job fields I have been working in since I graduated from school. As an Account Executive of beginning at Acteam, I learned all the selling skills at this Company (The company provides media services example EDN ASIA,EDN,Test & Measurement magazine to famous IT firms in Taiwan) including customerâ€™s management skills, cold call skills and all the required sales skills. I love sales job. It is because that fulls of challenges and accomplishments and it also needs strong self-motivation and management to overcome challenges. For me sales job is not only builds up my sales skills but also strengthens my fundamental capability.</p>

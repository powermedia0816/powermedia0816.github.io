<dir><em>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</em></dir>

<dir>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ </dir>
<h1>July 14, 2012</h1>
<dir>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."I definitely won't be passing any cars.</dir>
<h1>June 2, 2012</h1>
<dir>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</dir>
